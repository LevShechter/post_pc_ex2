# AndroidCalculator - Calculator exercise for Android developers

## In this project:
- Calculator screen with XML ready for portrait and landscape
- Calculator interface used by the Activity
- Unit tests for the calculator and the activity

## Your job:
- Implement `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- add more unit tests to `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- Implement `MainActivity.java`
- add more unit tests to `MainActivityTest.java`
- add more flow tests to `AppFlowTest.java`

Basically look for "TODO" in the code.


Good luck!

answers to Q:
we shouls add a method to the SimpleCalculatoImpl.java of insertMultiplication,
where we add "x".
we should add the functionality of when we see zero before or after this sign, we'll update the
output into zero, and etc.
we could run an arthmetic test such as "0x1", "100x9", "Cx100" etc.
on the activity we could check that the "x" button works proprly as expected.
